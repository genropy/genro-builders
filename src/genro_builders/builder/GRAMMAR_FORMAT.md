# `builder_grammar` v1.1 — format specification

**Last Updated**: 2026-09-29
**Status**: 🔴 DA REVISIONARE — documento non ancora approvato
**Format version**: 1.1

---

## 1. Purpose

The `builder_grammar` format is the **runtime contract** between a
Python builder (the producer, via `BuilderBase.to_grammar(path)`)
and any consumer that needs to reconstruct the same grammar in a
different environment:

- the **JavaScript builder** (genro-builders-js), which has no Python
  decorators and builds its class schema from JSON documents
  (`defineGrammar`, the equivalent of Python's `__init_subclass__`);
- the **Python loader**: a builder class names its documents in
  `_grammar_documents` and `__init_subclass__` composes them into
  `_class_schema` (§9);
- any downstream transpiler (JSON Schema, XSD, RELAX NG) that needs
  a neutral starting point.

The format is therefore **language-neutral**: it must be readable
and reconstructible without any Python-specific machinery. It is
**not** an interchange format with foreign ecosystems: the
vocabulary (`element`, `abstract`, `subbuilder`, `sub_tags` /
`parent_tags` cardinality, `inherits_from`) is the vocabulary of
the Genro builder system. A consumer that does not understand
those concepts cannot use the document — and that is by design.

---

## 2. File extension and identification

| Aspect | Convention |
|---|---|
| File extension | `.json` (plain JSON). Recommended basename matches `grammar.name`, e.g. `html.json`, `svg.json`. |
| Identification by **content** | The very first key of the document is `document_format`, whose `name` field equals `"builder_grammar"`. |
| MIME type (internal) | `application/vnd.genro.builder-grammar+json` (Genro convention, not IANA-registered). |

Content-based identification is the canonical way for tools to
recognize a `builder_grammar` document. The file name is a
convention, not a contract.

---

## 3. Document structure

A `builder_grammar` document is a JSON object with **four top-level
keys**, always present, in this exact order:

```json
{
  "document_format": {"name": "builder_grammar", "version": "1.1"},
  "grammar": {
    "name": "html",
    "version": null,
    "title": null,
    "description": null
  },
  "abstracts": { ... },
  "elements":  { ... }
}
```

Sub-builders and data-elements are **not** separate sections: they are
ordinary elements marked in their `_meta` (`_meta.subbuilder` for a
dialect boundary, `_meta.data_element` for a data-element). They appear
in the `elements` section like any other element, distinguished only by
that `_meta` marker (see §4.2).

### 3.1 `document_format`

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Always `"builder_grammar"`. Identifies the format. |
| `version` | string | Format version, `"1.1"`. Independent from `grammar.version`. A consumer refuses any other value. |

`document_format` is **always the first key** of the document.

### 3.2 `grammar`

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Canonical name of the grammar (e.g. `"html"`, `"svg"`, `"css"`). Comes from `BuilderBase._name`. |
| `version` | string \| null | Version of this specific grammar (e.g. `"5.2.0"` for HTML5 revision 2). Optional. |
| `title` | string \| null | Human-readable title. Optional. |
| `description` | string \| null | Long-form description. Optional. |

Optional metadata fields are **present** in the document with
`null` value, not omitted. The document shape is stable.

### 3.3 Two sections, in usage order

| Section | Contents |
|---|---|
| `abstracts` | Abstract templates that define shared `sub_tags` / `parent_tags`. Consumed by `inherits_from`. Always emitted first because elements reference them. |
| `elements` | Every instantiable, schema-validated element of the grammar — including sub-builder entry points (`_meta.subbuilder`) and data-elements (`_meta.data_element`), which are ordinary elements with a marker, not a separate section. |

Each section is a JSON object (not an array). Keys are element
names; values are the per-element form described in §4. **Both
sections are always present** even when empty (`{}`).

The sections are emitted in this order because a top-down reader
(e.g. the JavaScript bootstrap) wants to know the abstracts before
it processes the elements that inherit from them.

---

## 4. Per-element form

The shape of each per-element entry is fixed. The exporter writes
every key, missing values as explicit `null`. A consumer accepts an
entry that omits keys and reads them as `null`; it refuses an unknown
key.

### 4.1 Abstract

```json
{
  "doc": "Flow content (block-level).",
  "sub_tags": "p,div,section",
  "parent_tags": null,
  "inherits_from": null,
  "ns": null,
  "attributes": null,
  "_meta": null
}
```

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `doc` | string \| null | Documentation text (from the Python docstring of `@abstract`). |
| `sub_tags` | string \| null | Cardinality string for valid children. See §5. |
| `parent_tags` | string \| null | Cardinality string for valid parents. See §5. |
| `inherits_from` | string \| null | Comma-separated names of other abstracts (e.g. `"phrasing"` or `"phrasing,flow"`). **Literal, not resolved.** |
| `ns` | string \| null | Namespace prefix of the emitted tag (`@element(ns=...)`). |
| `attributes` | object \| null | Signature of the `@abstract` method. See §4.3. |
| `_meta` | object \| null | Pass-through metadata for renderers/compilers. No validation. |

### 4.2 Element

```json
{
  "doc": "Hyperlink.",
  "sub_tags": "a,abbr,b,em,strong",
  "parent_tags": null,
  "inherits_from": null,
  "ns": null,
  "attributes": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "kwargs", "kind": "var_keyword", "role": "attribute",
       "annotation": null, "has_default": false}
    ],
    "accepts_var_keyword": true,
    "accepts_var_positional": false
  },
  "node_label": null,
  "collection_key": null,
  "_meta": null
}
```

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `doc` | string \| null | Documentation text. |
| `sub_tags` | string \| null | Cardinality string for valid children. See §5. |
| `parent_tags` | string \| null | Cardinality string for valid parents. See §5. |
| `inherits_from` | string \| null | Comma-separated names of abstracts to inherit from. **Literal, not resolved.** See §6. |
| `ns` | string \| null | Namespace prefix of the emitted tag (`@element(ns=...)`). |
| `attributes` | object \| null | Signature of the element: its parameters. See §4.3. `null` declares no signature: every attribute is accepted, none is required. |
| `node_label` | string \| null | Default node label of a singleton element (`@element(node_label=...)`). |
| `collection_key` | string \| null | Child attribute or `${...}` template that labels the children (`@element(collection_key=...)`). |
| `_meta` | object \| null | Pass-through metadata. Also the **marker** that distinguishes special elements (see below). |

#### Sub-builders and data-elements via `_meta`

A sub-builder and a data-element are ordinary elements; what marks them
is a key in `_meta`, not a dedicated section or shape:

- **Sub-builder** — `_meta.subbuilder` declares the grammar the node
  switches to, in one of two string forms:

  - **Registry name** (no colon) — the canonical name of a registered
    grammar (matches some other `grammar.name`):

    ```json
    {
      "doc": "Embedded SVG drawing.",
      "sub_tags": "*",
      "parent_tags": null,
      "inherits_from": null,
      "ns": null,
      "attributes": null,
      "node_label": null,
      "collection_key": null,
      "_meta": {"subbuilder": "svg"}
    }
    ```

  - **Parameter reference** (`kwarg:attr`) — the grammar comes from the
    call site: the value the recipe passes as `kwarg` carries the
    grammar class in its `attr` attribute
    (`_meta": {"subbuilder": "app:grammar"}`). The kwarg left unset
    (or passed as `null`/`None`) means **no switch**: the node keeps
    the host dialect and, being marked as a sub-builder, stays
    transparent to containment — it does not police its children: a
    child tag unknown to the host grammar raises, a host-grammar child
    is accepted.

    **No reconstruction promise (v1.x).** The reference is exported
    verbatim as a plain string; a consumer cannot resolve `app:grammar`
    without the Python class the recipe passes at runtime. A consumer
    reading the document knows *that* the element mounts a
    caller-supplied grammar, not *which* one.

  The boundary envelope, when present, rides on `_meta` too
  (`_meta.render_tag` for the host-side wrap tag, `_meta.render_attributes`
  for the framework attributes emitted on it).

- **Data-element** — `_meta.data_element` marks an element that binds
  data-infrastructure (a tabular section, a setter/formula/controller).
  It is transparent at render time; binding details are not part of the
  neutral grammar contract.

  ```json
  {
    "doc": "Bind a tabular section.",
    "sub_tags": "",
    "parent_tags": null,
    "inherits_from": null,
    "ns": null,
    "attributes": null,
    "node_label": null,
    "collection_key": null,
    "_meta": {"data_element": "setter"}
  }
  ```

A consumer that does not recognise a `_meta` marker still sees a valid
element entry; the marker is additive information, not a different shape.

### 4.3 `attributes` — the signature

`attributes` describes the parameters of the declaring method, in
order, `self` excluded:

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `parameters` | array | One object per parameter (below). |
| `accepts_var_keyword` | boolean | A parameter has kind `var_keyword` (`**kwargs`): the attribute set is open. |
| `accepts_var_positional` | boolean | A parameter has kind `var_positional`. |

The two flags must agree with `parameters`; a consumer that finds them
absent computes them from `parameters`.

Each parameter:

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Identifier, unique in the list. |
| `kind` | string | `positional_only`, `positional_or_keyword`, `keyword_only`, `var_positional`, `var_keyword` (Python `inspect.Parameter.kind`, lowercase). |
| `role` | string | `framework` (a build-time parameter such as `node_tag`, not an attribute), `value` (`node_value`, the node value), `attribute`. |
| `annotation` | object \| null | Type descriptor (below). `null`: no annotation, no type check. |
| `has_default` | boolean | The parameter has a default: it may be omitted. |
| `default` | JSON value | Present if and only if `has_default` is `true`. |

A non-variadic `attribute` or `value` parameter without default is
**required**, by presence: an explicit `null` is a supplied value,
accepted only by a nullable annotation: no annotation, `any`,
`NoneType`, `builtins.object`, a literal listing `null`, a union with
such a member, an `annotated` whose base accepts it and whose metadata
holds no `range` / `regex` (e.g. `Optional[Annotated[int, Range(ge=1)]]`
accepts `null`, `Annotated[int, Range(ge=1)]` does not). JSON `true` / `false` are not numbers:
they fail `int` and `float`. The Python loader applies these rules,
taken from genro-builders-js 0.3.1, to the signatures it reads; a
decorated signature keeps the Python rules (`None` counts as missing,
`bool` is an `int`). A consumer reading a document (the Python loader,
genro-builders-js) skips the first positional non-framework parameter
of a component (`_meta.component`): it is the expansion root, supplied
by the renderer.

Type descriptors, by `kind`:

| `kind` | Fields | Python type |
|---|---|---|
| `any` | — | `Any` |
| `type` | `module`, `name` | A named type. Portable: `builtins.str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, `set`, `object`, `NoneType`, and `collections.abc.Callable`. |
| `union` | `items` (descriptors) | `A \| B` |
| `literal` | `values` (JSON values) | `Literal[...]` |
| `generic` | `origin` (a `type`), `arguments` (descriptors) | `list[...]`, `dict[...]`, `tuple[...]`, `set[...]` |
| `ellipsis` | — | `...` inside `tuple[T, ...]` |
| `annotated` | `base` (descriptor), `metadata` (array) | `Annotated[base, ...]` |

`annotated` metadata items: `{"kind": "regex", "pattern", "flags"}`
(`Regex`), `{"kind": "range", "ge", "le", "gt", "lt"}` (`Range`, every
bound present, `null` when unset), `{"kind": "value", "value"}` (plain
JSON metadata, no validation).

The exporter raises `TypeError` on an annotation with no descriptor
(a class defined in a function, callable metadata other than `Regex` /
`Range`) and on a default or `_meta` value that JSON cannot carry
losslessly (an object, a non-finite float, a tuple, a non-string dict
key). `to_grammar` builds the whole document before it opens the file,
so a failed export leaves an existing file unchanged. An empty `_meta`
is exported as `{}`, a missing one as `null`. The Python loader
refuses a `type` outside the portable list: a document never makes it
import a module.

---

## 5. `sub_tags` / `parent_tags` grammar

The `sub_tags` and `parent_tags` fields are **strings** that
declare child / parent constraints with cardinality. The format is:

```
<spec>      ::= <item> ("," <item>)*
<item>      ::= <name> <cardinality>?
<name>      ::= identifier   |  "*"
<cardinality> ::= "[" <min> ":" <max> "]"
                |  "[" <n> "]"
                |  "[]"
<min>       ::= integer | ""
<max>       ::= integer | "*" | ""
<n>         ::= integer
```

Semantics:

| Spec | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `""` (empty) | Leaf element. No children allowed. |
| `"*"` | Wildcard. Any children allowed, any number of times. |
| `"foo"` | Exactly one `foo` (default cardinality `[1:1]`). |
| `"foo[]"` | `foo` zero or more times (i.e. `[0:*]`). |
| `"foo[2]"` | Exactly two `foo`. |
| `"foo[2:5]"` | Two to five `foo`. |
| `"foo[1:*]"` | One or more `foo`. |
| `"foo,bar[]"` | Exactly one `foo`, plus zero or more `bar`. |

This is the same grammar used internally by `_parse_sub_tags_spec`
in `_grammar.py`. The spec is reproduced here so that the document
is self-contained: a consumer does not need to read Python source
to understand `sub_tags`.

---

## 6. `inherits_from` semantics

`inherits_from` is exported **literally**, as declared by the
grammar author. Examples:

```json
{"inherits_from": null}                  // no inheritance
{"inherits_from": "phrasing"}            // single parent
{"inherits_from": "phrasing,flow"}       // multiple parents
```

The document does **not** expand the inheritance: the inherited
`sub_tags` are not folded into the inheriting element. The
**consumer** is responsible for computing the transitive closure if
it needs it.

Rationale: consumers vary. A JavaScript builder may prefer the
closure to be pre-computed; a JSON Schema transpiler benefits from
the raw `inherits_from` (which becomes `allOf` in JSON Schema or
`xs:extension base` in XSD). Keeping the document literal pushes
the decision to the consumer.

**Invariant guaranteed by the exporter**: every name in
`inherits_from` resolves to an existing key in `abstracts`. The
exporter validates this at class-definition time in Python's
`__init_subclass__`. Consumers can therefore assume that
`inherits_from` references are never dangling. If a consumer
encounters a dangling reference, the document is malformed —
report it as a producer bug.

---

## 7. Section ordering and topological sort

### 7.1 Top-level sections

The four top-level keys appear in this exact order:

1. `document_format`
2. `grammar`
3. `abstracts`
4. `elements`

Rationale: a top-down reader processes definitions before usages.
`abstracts` define contracts; `elements` reference them (and carry
sub-builders and data-elements as `_meta`-marked entries).

### 7.2 Inside each section

Within each section, keys are emitted in **topological order**
relative to `inherits_from` dependencies, with insertion-order from
the source class schema as the secondary key.

For `abstracts`, this means an abstract like `flow` that declares
`inherits_from: 'phrasing'` appears **after** `phrasing` in the
section.

For `elements`, in practice today, elements inherit only from
abstracts (which live in a different section), so the topological
constraint inside `elements` collapses to insertion-order.

The guarantee is: **for any key K in a section, every name in
K's `inherits_from` either lives in another section that came
earlier (i.e. `abstracts`), or lives in the same section at an
earlier index**.

---

## 8. Versioning and evolution

Two independent versions live in the document:

- **`document_format.version`** — the version of **this format**.
  Bumped when the structure changes (additive in `v1.x`, breaking
  in `v2.0`). Consumers should check this before parsing.
- **`grammar.version`** — the version of the **specific grammar
  being described**. Bumped when the grammar itself evolves (e.g.
  HTML5.2 → HTML5.3). Independent from format version.

A producer is responsible for emitting `document_format.version`
that matches the format actually used. A consumer is responsible
for checking it and refusing documents with unsupported versions.

---

## 9. Grammar documents on a builder class

A builder class declares its grammar with decorators, with JSON
documents, or with both. Two class attributes of `BuilderBase`
control it:

| Attribute | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `_grammar_documents` | `()` | Tuple of paths of v1.1 documents of THIS class. A relative path is resolved against the directory of the module that defines the class. The documents override the class's decorated methods. |
| `_decorated_elements` | `True` | `False`: the decorated methods of THIS class (`@element`, `@abstract`) do not enter its grammar. They are still removed from the class. |

Both are read from the class's own namespace: a subclass does not
inherit them.

```python
from genro_builders.contrib.html import HtmlBuilder

class Dialect(HtmlBuilder):
    _name = "dialect"
    _grammar_documents = ("grammars/binding.json",)
```

`__init_subclass__` builds `_class_schema` in layers, each applied on
top of the previous one:

1. the grammar of the parent builder class; a direct subclass of
   `BuilderBase` starts from the data-elements declared on
   `BuilderBase` (`dataSetter`, `dataFormula`, `dataController`);
2. the class's decorated methods, unless `_decorated_elements` is
   `False`;
3. the class's `_grammar_documents`, in declared order.

The grammar of a class is therefore composed along the class chain,
parent first, as `defineGrammar` composes it in genro-builders-js.

**Replace rule.** When a layer defines an element (or an abstract)
that an earlier layer defines, the new entry replaces the earlier one
entirely: parameters, `sub_tags`, `parent_tags`, `inherits_from`,
`ns`, `doc`, `node_label`, `collection_key`, `_meta`. Nothing is
merged; a key the new entry leaves `null` stays `null`. Elements not
named by the layer are inherited unchanged. The data-elements follow
the same rule: a subclass redefines `dataSetter` with its own
signature, e.g. `dataSetter(destination_path, value=None, **attr)`.

A name declared both by a decorator and by a document of the same
class is not an error: the document's entry replaces the decorator's
entirely, by the same rule. A malformed document raises `ValueError`
naming the file and the field. Besides the shape of every key, the
loader checks what genro-builders-js 0.3.1 checks: finite JSON numbers
only (`NaN`, `Infinity` refused), `parent_tags` names that are
identifiers without duplicates, unique parameter names, variadic flags
that match the parameters, regular expressions that compile and are
portable (flags limited to `MULTILINE`, `DOTALL`, `UNICODE`; no
`IGNORECASE`; no `\A \Z \w \W \d \D \s \S`, `(?P<`, `(?P=`, `(?P!`, `(?(`,
`(?>`), `sub_tags` without a repeated tag or a maximum below the
minimum.
After all the layers of a class, `__init_subclass__` checks that every
`inherits_from` name exists and that no abstract chain is a cycle.

The export of a class (`to_grammar`) is a v1.1 document that a class
reads back through `_grammar_documents` as the same grammar. The shared
fixtures in `tests/fixtures/class_grammar/` (three input documents and
the two expected composed grammars) are the cross-language contract
with genro-builders-js.

---

## 10. Known limitations of v1.1

- **Abstract signatures**: in Python the `attributes` of an abstract
  are exported and read back, but do not validate the calls of the
  elements that inherit from it. genro-builders-js copies them onto an
  inheriting element whose `attributes` is `null`.
- **No transpiler**: the format is the **source** of downstream
  transpilers (JSON Schema, XSD, RELAX NG) but does not include any
  of them. Transpilers are separate tools.
- **No CLI**: the exporter API is `Class.to_grammar(path)`. A
  command-line tool may be added later.
- **`_meta` is opaque**: the format does not validate `_meta`
  contents. By convention, `_meta` values must be JSON-friendly
  (no callables, no class objects). A producer that includes
  non-JSON values will fail at serialization time with a standard
  `json.dumps` error.

## Riferimenti

Documento prodotto nella sessione Claude Code locale del 2026-05-19
sul subtask `schema_export` (genro-builders). Riallineato il 2026-06-06
al modello unificato `@element`+`_meta` (sub-builder e data-element non
sono più sezioni separate: due chiavi top-level invece di sei).
