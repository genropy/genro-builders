# Implementation roadmap — open work

**Last Updated**: 2026-08-04
**Status**: 🟢 ALIGNED with contract v0.9.0, code at 0.23.1.

This document is intentionally **not a plan**. It maps what is open and
how the open pieces depend on each other; it does not pick an order and
does not record decisions. Decisions live in
[architecture-contract.md](architecture-contract.md).

---

## 1. Where the code stands

The static-first core is complete and the areas it closed are no longer
open work. Implemented and covered by tests (340 green at 0.23.1):

- **Data, pull-based** — path grammar, `^`/`=` pointers, `${}` templates
  with consumed inputs, `mask`/`_wdg` presentation, read-time pointer
  registration (`DAT.2`, `DAT.5`, `DAT.6`). A `BagResolver` found as a
  value or as an attribute resolves through `runtime_values`.
- **Datastore** — ONE flat Bag owned by the builder (`builder.data`,
  reachable from any node as `node.data`). `BuilderHandler` is gone
  (`a83e61e`), and with it multibuilder and datastore segmentation.
- **Render subsystem** — universal walk, per-node dialect dispatch, and
  the two steps: `materialize(mode)` keeps its result in
  `materialized[mode]`, `finalize` delivers it. Rendering does not
  validate — `validate_source()` reports on demand (`RND`, `PAG.4`,
  `PAG.7`).
- **Data elements** — `dataSetter`/`dataFormula`/`dataController` as
  marked `@element`, every kind computed once at `create()`, in document
  order (`DAT.3`, `DAT.4`).
- **Components** — `@component` in its three calling forms
  (single/store/iterate, fractal composition) and `@container`
  (`CMP.9`): the body runs once and writes real nodes the caller fills.
- **Sub-builders** — `@element` marked `subbuilder`, including the
  parameter-reference form `"kwarg:attr"`, where the governing grammar
  arrives as a call-site argument (`BLD.2`).
- **Dialects** — HTML5, SVG, CSS level 1, XSLT 1.0, XSD, and Config
  (`ConfigBuilder` + the callable `ConfigHandler`, four-layer read,
  parent recipes).
- **Grammar export** — `to_grammar(path)` writes the schema as a
  portable document (`_grammar_export.py`, format in
  `src/genro_builders/builder/GRAMMAR_FORMAT.md`).

Retired areas, not open work: `HND` (the handler), `APP` (the
application layer, now genro-ws-web), and the whole push-reactive
apparatus — `live()`, the patch protocol, the render queue, the lazy
lane, derived identity. Where to fish that code out of git is recorded
in [reactivity/removed-machinery.md](reactivity/removed-machinery.md).

## 2. The open axes

### 2.1 Reactive engine (`RX.5`) — research

Fine-grained reactivity is a **separate engine**, not a repair of the
core. The grammar is shared; the static engine EXECUTES the
data-elements while the reactive one carries them. Everything that used
to be listed here as "reactivity granularity" is inside this axis now:
partial re-render off the kept `materialized` result, per-row component
reactivity (`CMP.7`), the data-element cascade (multi-wave compute, ex
"slice 2"), variable datapath and master-detail
([reactivity/variable-datapath.md](reactivity/variable-datapath.md)).
The `roadmap/reactivity/` documents were written against contract
v0.5.0: they are starting material to re-read under `RX.5`, not a
specification to implement.

### 2.2 `@slot(node_id)` (`PAG.6`)

Fill-by-id at node birth. Design complete
([slot-decorator.md](slot-decorator.md)), code absent. The guide case is
a frame whose header/footer panels are filled by the page that mounts
it.

### 2.3 `from_grammar` loader

`to_grammar` writes the schema; nothing reads it back. The loader
reconstructs a builder class from an exported grammar document — the
symmetric half, and the precondition of the JS twin consuming the same
file.

### 2.4 `include_components` (`CMP.6`) — implemented, untested

Per-instance grammar enrichment from mixins exists
(`BuilderBase.include_components`) and is documented, but no test
exercises it. Either cover it or decide it is not part of the surface.

### 2.5 Cross-runtime

"One language, two interpreters": the semantic contract of the source,
the JS twin (bag/builder client-side), golden tests (same recipe → same
tree). Far horizon; constrains design today (named components,
func-by-name, the exported grammar format).

## 3. Smaller open items

Tracked as GitHub issues, each independent of the axes above: collection
re-declaration semantics (#31), the HTML `<label>` tag masked by
`BagNode.label` (#29), inferring `main_tag` for `@component` (#26),
Python→JS transpiling of formulas (#19), `Coerce` in `Annotated`
metadata (#14), optional root-element schema validation (#13), friendly
validation errors (#11).

Documentation gap: the XSLT dialect ships without a reference page under
`docs/grammars/` (its grammar and transpiler live in
`src/genro_builders/contrib/xslt/`).

## 4. Dependency hints

- `RX.5` gates the reactive half of components (`CMP.7`) and the
  data-element cascade; nothing else waits on it.
- `@slot` and `from_grammar` are independent of each other and of
  `RX.5`: both are pure static-core work.
- `from_grammar` gates the cross-runtime axis, which cannot consume a
  grammar nobody can load.
- Downstream consumers (genro-ws-web, genro-textual, genro-print,
  genro-scriba) put real-world pressure on `PAG`/`BLD` and inform the
  preset question left open in the contract.

## 5. What this document is not

- Not a plan: no axis is scheduled.
- Not a commitment: any sentence here frames discussion.
- Not a substitute for the contract: decisions are recorded there (or in
  `component-design.md` for the component record).
